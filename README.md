# international-chat

The goal is to make a server and a chat client. The server must be able to manage the list of active users (registration/unregistration) and to control their presence (brutal disconnection of a user). <br/><br/>

The user can dialogue within the framework of a room, or within the framework of a private discussion. When he connects, the user can retrieve the list of rooms and the list of active users.<br/><br/>

On connection, the user chooses his language of discussion. If his interlocutor uses a language different from his, all the messages he receives will be automatically translated into his language.<br/><br/>

A client interface is also present.
